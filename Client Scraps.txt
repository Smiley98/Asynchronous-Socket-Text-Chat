*I didn't add this because it would be doing the exact same thing as before just making threads once instead of every frame (not worth decrease legibility)*

Client.h:
void controller();
void receiver();
void sender();

std::thread m_controller;
std::thread m_receiver;
std::thread m_sender;

Client start:
//std::thread(&Client::controller, this).detach();
//std::thread(&Client::receiver, this).detach();
//std::thread(&Client::sender, this).detach();
m_controller = std::thread(&Client::controller, this);
m_receiver = std::thread(&Client::receiver, this);
m_sender = std::thread(&Client::sender, this);

Client running:
void Client::receiver()
{
	while (running()) {

	}
}

void Client::sender()
{
	while (running()) {

	}
}
